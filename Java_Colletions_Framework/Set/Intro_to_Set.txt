Set in Java
In Java, a Set is an unordered collection that:
✅ Does not allow duplicate elements
✅ Does not provide indexed access (no get(index))
✅ Implements the Set interface in the Java Collections Framework (JCF)

🛠 Types of Sets in Java
Java provides two commonly used implementations of Set:

1️⃣ HashSet → Fastest performance, no ordering, backed by a HashMap
2️⃣ LinkedHashSet → Maintains insertion order, slightly slower than HashSet

⚡ Quick Comparisons
Feature	                    HashSet	                                        LinkedHashSet
Allows Duplicates?	           ❌ No	                                            ❌ No
Maintains Order?	           ❌ No (Unordered)	                                ✅ Yes (Insertion Order Preserved)
Performance	                   ✅ Fast (O(1) on average)	                        🔶 Slightly slower than HashSet
Internal Structure	            Uses HashMap internally	                          Uses LinkedHashMap internally
Best Use Case	                performance is a priority.	                      order preservation.


🚀 Summary
Use HashSet when ordering is not important and you need the best performance.
Use LinkedHashSet when you need to preserve the insertion order of elements.
